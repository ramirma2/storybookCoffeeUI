<Title>Product Card</Title>

The **Product Card** displays key information about a product — typically an image, title, and short description.  

## When to Use

- To showcase a single product in a catalog or collection view.  
- To provide a quick preview before navigating to a detailed product page.  
- When you need a consistent layout for displaying multiple products.

## Accessibility

### Semantic HTML
- Uses proper heading hierarchy (`<h3>` for product name)
- Card content wrapped in `<article>` or semantic container

### Images
- All product images include descriptive `alt` text
- Alt text describes the product (e.g., "Ethiopian single origin coffee bag")
- Decorative images should use `alt=""` to hide from screen readers

### Color and Contrast
- Text meets WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Price and product information remain readable
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information (e.g., "Sale" badges)

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements accessible via keyboard (Tab key)
- Logical tab order follows visual layout
- Enter/Space activates buttons

### Screen Reader Support
- Product availability announced (e.g., "Out of stock")
- Sale prices include original price for context
- Use `aria-label` for additional context if needed (e.g., "Add Ethiopian Coffee to cart")
