<Title>Navigation</Title>

The **NavBar** component provides site-wide navigation and branding. It supports links, logos, responsive behavior, and a mobile toggle menu.

## Examples

<Stories/>

## Responsive Behavior

The NavBar automatically adapts at configured breakpoints (e.g., `768px`).  
On smaller screens, the navigation collapses into a toggle button.  
Make sure to include:

- `aria-expanded` on the toggle button
- `aria-controls` linking to the mobile menu container
- keyboard accessibility for menu items
